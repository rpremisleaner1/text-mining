# Project Writeup

## Project Overview

In this project, I sought to collect analyze data from the ratings of three movies (War Dogs, Moneyball, and 21 Jump Street) starred by my favorite artist, Jonah Hill. More specifically, I choose to scrape five reviews from IMDB using the Cinemagoer package, and subsequently conduct analysis on the most used words from reviews as well as the sentiment scores related to those reviews based on NLP techniques. After using cinemagoer to scrape those reviews, I transformed these sources into the appropriate data sources, such as sorted dictionaries and lists, in order to further manipulate them using Pandas. Since I am relatively well-versed in R, I especially hoped to better my understanding in using Pandas to manipulate dataframes in Python, as well as how to use the plotline package to construct beautiful graphs. Furthermore, I wanted to also understand how the sentiment values derived from NLP techniques compared to my own priors regarding those movies.

## Implementation

As mentioned before, the cinemagoer Python package was used to scrape the movie reviews from IMDB. To do this, I searched for each of the movie names using the search functions provided by the package, then accessed each of the reviews by accessing their respective dictionary element and transforming them into lists. There were two main goals then: (1) to create a histogram based on the top N (in my case, 5) words from each of the K (in my case, 5) movie reviews, as well as (2) estimate the sentiment scores linked to each of these reviews. 

To accomplish the first goal, I transformed each of the (now listed) reviews into dictionaries, and created sorted those dictionaries from high to low for the top 5 words. Since I did not want to include any stopwords, I filtered only for words not contained in the set of stopwords inside the for loop. This sorted dictionary was then transformed into a list containing word:frequency pairs. An alternative in this case would have been to simply return a dictionary or a tuple, but I choose to return a list to make it easier to transform it into a Pandas dataframe for further manipulation. Moreover, I thought about transforming the list into a numpy array, but changed my mind. Either way, the list would have more easily allowed for the final transformation into an object that is accepted by plotline.

With regards to the second goal, the process was relatively similar. Since I had a list of five reviews, I created a for loop to read through each of them so that the polarity scores derived from the nltk package could be derived. What was most different from the first part was that I now also wanted to do some data manipulation with the values derived, that is, calculated the mean score for each sentiment category and group. After deriving these scores, I then had to somehow merge these different dataframes into one. There were multiple alternatives for this, such as concatenating each of the dataframes, but I choose to simply append each of the lists/dataframes into each other so that I would be able to conduct the data analysis desired. The necessity for data manipulation lead to myself having to do some research on how to manipulate dataframe in Python in a similar fashion to R's dplyr package. I eventually was able to achieve my final goal and plot the mean value for each sentiment score and movie.
