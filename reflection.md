# Project Writeup

## Project Overview

In this project, I sought to collect analyze data from the ratings of three movies (War Dogs, Moneyball, and 21 Jump Street) starred by my favorite artist, Jonah Hill. More specifically, I choose to scrape five reviews from IMDB using the Cinemagoer package, and subsequently conduct analysis on the most used words from reviews as well as the sentiment scores related to those reviews based on NLP techniques. After using cinemagoer to scrape those reviews, I transformed these sources into the appropriate data sources, such as sorted dictionaries and lists, in order to further manipulate them using Pandas. Since I am relatively well-versed in R, I especially hoped to better my understanding in using Pandas to manipulate dataframes in Python, as well as how to use the plotline package to construct beautiful graphs. Furthermore, I wanted to also understand how the sentiment values derived from NLP techniques compared to my own priors regarding those movies.
